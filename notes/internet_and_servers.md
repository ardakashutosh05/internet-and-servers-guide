# 🌐 Internet & Servers — Full Notes

---

## 🌍 What is the Internet?
- A network of networks.
- Devices communicate using IP addresses via routers/switches.

---

## 🤝 How Does It Work?

1. **Client → DNS** (finds IP)
2. **Client → Server** via IP + Port
3. **Server responds** with data

Example:
- You type `youtube.com`
- Browser sends DNS request → gets IP (like 142.250.71.110)
- Connects via port 443 (HTTPS)

## 🖥️ What is a Server?
- A system that **provides services** to other devices (clients).
- Types:
  - Web Server (Apache, Nginx)
  - File Server (FTP, SFTP)
  - Database Server (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
